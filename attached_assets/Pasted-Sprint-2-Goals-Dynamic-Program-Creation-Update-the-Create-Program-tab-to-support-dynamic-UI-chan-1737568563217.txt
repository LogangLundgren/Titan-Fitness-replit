Sprint 2 Goals
Dynamic Program Creation:

Update the "Create Program" tab to support dynamic UI changes based on program type:
Lifting Program: Exercises, sets, reps, training days.
Diet Plan: Macros, food types, meal times, and nutrition details.
Posing Plan: Bio and details, along with a communication channel.
Comprehensive Coaching Program: Combine the above into a single program.
Predefined Templates:

Add basic templates for common use cases to speed up program creation.
Program Editing:

Global Edits: Allow coaches to make changes to a base program that applies to all enrolled clients.
Client-Specific Edits: Allow custom adjustments for individual client versions of a program.
UI Improvements:

Ensure seamless transitions between program types with clear navigation and validation.
Proposed Implementation Steps
Step 1: Create Dynamic Program UI
Add a dropdown menu to select program type (e.g., Lifting, Diet, Posing).
Render dynamic forms based on the selected program type:
Lifting: Add fields for exercises, sets, reps, and training days.
Diet: Include fields for macros (e.g., protein, carbs, fats), meal plans, and food types.
Posing: Include a bio input and a text area for additional details.
Step 2: Integrate Predefined Templates
Create a “Load Template” button.
Add predefined templates (e.g., a 3-day lifting split or a basic 1500-calorie diet plan) based on common use cases.
Store templates in the database with proper schema updates.
Step 3: Implement Program Editing
Add an "Edit Program" button for global updates.
Ensure global edits propagate to all clients.
Allow program-specific customization from the coach’s dashboard:
Use a modal or dedicated page for client-specific adjustments.
Step 4: Optimize Database Schema
Add a program_type field to distinguish between Lifting, Diet, Posing, and Comprehensive programs.
Create sub-tables for:
Exercises (exercise_id, program_id, sets, reps, etc.)
Meal Plans (meal_id, program_id, macros, etc.)
Test relationships and data flow.
Step 5: Testing
Test program creation and editing for all program types.
Validate database entries for proper relationships and data integrity.
Ensure templates load correctly and edits are reflected in the UI.
Prompt for Replit AI
Here’s the prompt to give to your AI for Sprint 2:

"Start implementing Sprint 2: Create Program Tab Enhancements. Follow these steps:

Update the database schema to include:
A program_type field to distinguish between program types.
Sub-tables for exercises (exercise_id, program_id, sets, reps) and meal plans (meal_id, program_id, macros, foods).
Test the functionality thoroughly:
Validate UI behavior for all program types.
Verify database updates for program creation, templates, and edits.
Confirm that client-specific edits are saved correctly.
Provide SQL scripts for any necessary schema updates and data tests."
