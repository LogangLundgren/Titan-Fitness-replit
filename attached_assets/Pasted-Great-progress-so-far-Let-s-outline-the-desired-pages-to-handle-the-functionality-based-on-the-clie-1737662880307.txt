Next Steps
Fix the 404: Ensure routes are registered properly on the frontend and backend for all necessary pages.
Frontend: Update React Router or routing mechanism to handle these paths.
Backend: Ensure API endpoints support fetching data for these routes.
Implement Page Skeletons: Start with basic layouts for each page and test navigation.
Connect Backend: Ensure each page dynamically fetches and displays program-specific data.
