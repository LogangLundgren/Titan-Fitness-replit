We need to debug and enhance the "Manage Program" functionality in our application. Here's what we need:

### Current Issues:
1. The "Manage Program" page does not load all associated data (e.g., workout days, meal plans, posing details).
2. Changes made to program details are not reflected in the marketplace version after saving.
3. Posing details are missing from the database, so they cannot be loaded or edited.

### Expected Behavior:
1. When the "Manage" button is clicked:
   - Fetch the program details (from the `programs` table) and associated data:
     - Workout plans: From `program_exercises`, `routines`, and `program_schedule`.
     - Meal plans: From `meal_logs` (if relevant fields exist).
     - Posing details: Check if these fields exist; if not, update the database schema.
2. Allow coaches to edit all fetched data, including program details and associated routines or exercises.
3. Save changes so that the marketplace version of the program is updated without affecting client-specific programs.

### Debugging Steps:
1. Check the frontend files handling the "Manage Program" page:
   - Look for data-fetching logic (React Query or Axios calls).
   - Ensure all API endpoints are being called correctly.
2. Review backend API routes responsible for fetching and saving program data:
   - Verify data-fetching queries include relationships between `programs`, `program_exercises`, `routines`, and `program_schedule`.
   - Ensure posing details are being handled appropriately in the database and backend.
3. Confirm that save operations in the backend update the correct records.

### Tasks for Replit AI:
1. Identify and fix the missing data-fetching logic in the "Manage Program" page.
2. Update the backend API to fetch and return all necessary program data (e.g., workout days, meal plans, posing details).
3. If posing details are missing from the database schema, update the schema to include this data.
4. Ensure save operations only update the marketplace version of the program.
5. Document all changes and test for successful implementation.
