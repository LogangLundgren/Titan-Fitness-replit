Updated Prompt for Replit AI
Objective: Implement the functionality for a client's enrolled programs to display correctly on their "Programs" tab and enable program-specific logging functionality. Ensure that each enrolled program creates a unique copy for the client in the database. This ensures that any updates or changes made by the coach to a program are specific to that client and do not affect the global program or other clients.

1. Enrolled Programs Display
Retrieve Enrolled Programs:

Fetch unique client-specific program data from the client_programs table based on the client_id.
Ensure the client_programs table includes a reference to the original program ID (from programs), but also stores unique data specific to the clientâ€™s version of the program, such as:
Program Name
Description
Type (e.g., Lifting, Meal Plan, Posing)
Progress (if applicable)
Customizations made by the coach for the specific client.
Display Programs:

Update the client's "Programs" tab to list all enrolled programs.
Ensure programs are grouped by type (e.g., Lifting, Meal Plan, Posing).
Include buttons for each program to:
View Details: Opens a detailed page for the client-specific program.
Log Progress: Opens the logging interface specific to the client-specific program type.
2. Logging Functionality
General Logging Requirements:

Use the unique client-specific program data (from client_programs) to allow clients to log progress.
Ensure logs are linked to the unique client-specific program ID.
A. Lifting Program Logging

For each workout day:
List all exercises, sets, and reps from the client-specific version of the program.
Allow the client to log:
Actual sets and reps completed.
Notes for each exercise.
Save logs to the workout_logs table, linking them to the correct client-specific program ID and routine ID.
B. Meal Plan Logging

Allow clients to:
Log meals eaten (with macro details like calories, protein, carbs, fats).
Save the logs to the meal_logs table, linked to the client-specific program ID.
Display a summary of logged meals for the day.
C. Posing Program Logging

Enable a file upload feature for videos/images.
Allow clients to send notes or messages to their coach.
Save logs to a communication_logs table, linked to the client-specific program ID.
3. Frontend Updates
Programs Tab:

Add a section to display enrolled programs, categorized by type.
Include a "View Details" button for client-specific program details and "Log Progress" for the logging interface.
Logging Interfaces:

Create logging forms for:
Lifting programs (exercise-based).
Meal plans (macro-based).
Posing programs (communication-based).
Ensure smooth navigation between the programs tab and the logging interfaces.
4. Backend Updates
Database Updates:

Update the client_programs table to include:

A reference to the original program ID from programs.
All client-specific program data, such as workout details, meal plans, and posing details.
Ensure logs are linked to client-specific program IDs:

workout_logs for lifting programs.
meal_logs for meal plans.
communication_logs for posing programs.
Data Handling:

When a client enrolls in a program:
Copy the program data from programs into client_programs, creating a unique client-specific program record.
Ensure the copied data includes all details needed for lifting, meal plans, or posing.
Data Storage:

Save logs to the correct tables:
workout_logs for lifting programs.
meal_logs for meal plans.
communication_logs for posing programs.
Error Handling:

Handle cases where a client has no enrolled programs gracefully.
Validate all input data before saving logs.
5. Testing
Test that enrolling in a program creates a unique client-specific program copy.
Test that enrolled programs appear correctly in the "Programs" tab.
Test logging functionality for each program type:
Ensure data is saved to the appropriate database tables.
Verify updates reflect correctly in the UI.
Test edge cases (e.g., missing or incorrect data).
