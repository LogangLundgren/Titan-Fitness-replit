Based on the updated issue, here are the files and areas you should focus on:

Files to Investigate:
API Logic: Backend Endpoint

File Name: The backend file that handles the GET /api/client/programs endpoint.
Purpose: This is responsible for querying the client_programs table and returning the list of enrolled programs for the logged-in client.
What to Check:
Query correctness: Does it filter by client_id?
Ensure it fetches all relevant details (e.g., program name, type, and details from related tables).
Example:

If using Express.js: Look for a route like:
javascript
Copy
Edit
app.get("/api/client/programs", (req, res) => {
  // Database query to fetch programs
});
If using a framework like Next.js, check the api/client/programs.js or similar file.
Database Query Layer

File Name: If the database queries are abstracted in a separate file/module, look for the function responsible for querying client_programs.
What to Check:
Does the query correctly join client_programs with the programs table to fetch program details?
Ensure no filters unintentionally exclude programs.
Example Query:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT cp.*, p.name, p.type, p.description
FROM client_programs cp
JOIN programs p ON cp.program_id = p.id
WHERE cp.client_id = 1;
Frontend: Data Fetching
File Name: The file or component that fetches programs for the client.
Common Names:
programs.js (or equivalent) under pages, api, or hooks.
A React hook like useClientPrograms.
What to Check:
Verify the API call correctly points to the /api/client/programs endpoint.
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const { data: programs } = useQuery(["clientPrograms"], fetchClientPrograms);
Ensure the response from the API matches the expected data structure.
Frontend: Programs Tab
File Name: The React component responsible for rendering the "Programs" tab for clients.
Common Names:
ClientPrograms.js or ProgramsTab.js.
Could also be within the Dashboard component for clients.
What to Check:
Ensure the component properly renders the data fetched from the API.
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
programs.map((program) => (
  <Card key={program.id}>
    <CardContent>
      <h2>{program.name}</h2>
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
));
Frontend: Global Navigation Bar
File Name: The React component rendering the navigation bar.
Common Names: Navbar.js, GlobalNavigation.js.
What to Check:
Remove the "Meal Log" link or button but keep the page accessible elsewhere.
Suggested Debugging Steps:
Verify API Response:

Use Postman or a similar tool to test the /api/client/programs endpoint.
Ensure it returns the correct list of programs for client_id = 1.
Inspect the Frontend Fetch Logic:

Add console logs to check if the data is being fetched correctly and passed to the component.
Inspect Rendering Logic:

Add logs or debug points in the "Programs" tab component to see if the data is being passed down to the card rendering logic.
Fix the Global Navigation Bar:

Remove the "Meal Log" link by commenting it out or conditionally rendering it only for specific roles (e.g., coach).
Let me know if you'd like help analyzing specific files or writing debugging logs.
