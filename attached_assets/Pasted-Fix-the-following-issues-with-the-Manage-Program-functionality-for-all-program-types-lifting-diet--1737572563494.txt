Fix the following issues with the Manage Program functionality for all program types (lifting, diet, posing, and comprehensive coaching):

Missing Program Information:

Ensure the API call (GET /api/programs/:id) retrieves all relevant data for the selected program. This includes:
Program details (e.g., name, description, price).
Specific plan information:
Lifting: Exercises, sets, reps, and training days.
Diet: Meals, macros, and meal times.
Posing: Bio and any associated notes.
Update the frontend to display all fetched information in the Manage Program page, allowing the coach to edit all relevant data.
Save Changes Not Updating:

Ensure the Save Changes button sends all updated information to the backend for all program types. The payload must include:
Updated program details (e.g., name, description, price).
Updated program-specific data (e.g., exercises, meals, bio).
Fix the backend API endpoint (PUT /api/programs/:id) to:
Save both program details and program-specific data correctly in the database.
Ensure that the updated data reflects on the marketplace and My Programs tab.
Global Update Only for Marketplace Programs:

Ensure that the Manage Program button and updates only affect the version of the program on the marketplace.
Do not apply changes to the client-specific versions of the program. Those should remain untouched unless updated elsewhere.
Test and Validate:

Verify that all program information loads correctly on the Manage Program page for each program type.
Confirm that changes made to program details and plan-specific data are saved and reflected correctly in the marketplace and My Programs tab.
Test that client-specific versions of the program remain unchanged after updates through the Manage Program page.
Notes:
This update applies to all program types to ensure consistency across the application.
Focus on making the Manage Program feature robust and efficient for all use cases.
